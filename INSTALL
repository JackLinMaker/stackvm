First you'll need these modules on npm (http://npmjs.org):
    npm install dnode png jpeg video base64

SQLite isn't in npm yet, annoyingly. Anyways, you can get it here:
    http://github.com/orlandov/node-sqlite.git

Also add jquery.js, jquery.ui.js, and jquery.mousewheel.js to static/js/vendor/

TODO: proper package.json, auto-fetch jquery stuff
