First you'll need node.js. Download, unpack and install it from http://nodejs.org/

Next, you'll need npm:

    git clone http://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
    cd npm
    bash ./scripts/install.sh

Next, you'll need these node.js modules. They can be installed via npm:

    npm install dnode bufferlist rfb png jpeg gif video base64

To get them compiles make sure you have libjpeg, libpng, giflib, libtheora and libogg.

Then get the stackvm itself:

    git clone http://github.com/substack/stackvm.git

Next get jquery, jquery-ui and jquery-mouswheel plugin [1].

Put them in static/js/vendor directory and make sure jquery is named just jquery.js,
and jquery-ui is named jquery-ui.js.

Then make sure you have qemu and an image you want to run. 

Edit data/users.json to add yourself, and then `mkdir -p users/yournick/disks`. Put the
vm image in that directory.

Then start manager.js:

    node bin/manager.js

And then webstack.js:

    node bin/webstack.js

Now go to http://localhost:9000.
